  summary: >
    Ben is from Florence Alabama where he studied Computer Science at the Univserity of North Alabama.
    He currently serves as a Senior Software Engineer at Trideum.
    His past roles include Research Engineer at Auburn University and AI/ML Software Engineer at MTSI.

    Richard hails from Tulsa.
    He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!)
    Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer.
    While his work focuses on applied information theory,
    mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants,
    his non-work interests range widely,
    everything from quantum computing to chaos theory.
    He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!
